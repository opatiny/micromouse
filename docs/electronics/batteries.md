# Batteries of the micromouse and power management

The power supply of the micromouse is a really important aspect. We need to be able to deliver enough energy in a short time lapse in order to ensure good acceleration. We need relatively high power for the motors (with a higher voltage: 6-12V) and a low voltage for the microcontrollers and sensors (3.3V). We will therefore need a voltage regulator circuit.
