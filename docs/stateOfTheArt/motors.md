# Choice of the motors

"If you are a beginner we would suggest you to go with 200–400 RPM. But in general a motor with **600RPM** is fine and it’s definitely fast enough. Also, if you want to either increase or decrease the speed after buying motors, try changing the diameter of the wheels." - https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/mm-sensors-and-motors-7fa3a870db67

## Best motors

I should have bought motors with the encoders directly built in: https://www.pololu.com/product/5211

The encoders we bought have 12CPR, but they are some disks with 20CPR that we could buy and that are compatible with our encoder: https://www.pololu.com/product/3498
