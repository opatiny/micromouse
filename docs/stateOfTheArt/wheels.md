# Robot wheels

We want relatively thin wheels with a rubber tires to increase the friction coefficient with the floor (the maximum acceleration of the robot is directly proportional to the friction coefficient).

We estimate that the ideal wheels dimension are around **25-30mm diameter and 10mm thick**. Smaller wheels allow for a better reactivity of the robot, but the risk is that the maximal robot speed is smaller and can be reached quickly, hence limiting the robot speed.

## 3D printing wheels

Can we 3D print the tires? If yes, what material should we use? -> paper exactly on this topic: Surface friction of rapidly prototyped wheels from 3D-printed thermoplastic elastomers

Quote: "NinjaFlex was the softest material tested, hence the one most difficult to print, and only one of the three 3D-printers used managed to produce a good quality part. This was also the material providing the highest friction coefficient for all wheel designs."
